# Quantum-Chess

The age old game of chess where the pieces have quantum properties.

Game Rules :

1. A Quantum move can be made with all the pieces except pawn.
2. If the player chooses to make a quantum move they make two moves with pieces that are not entangled with each other. Only one of the two moves actually takes pace but the board is in superposition of the scenario where either of the move takes place. These two pieces ofcourse get entangled afterwards
3. The pawns can move to a position with quantum piece which will force a calculation on the piece in the position
4. The pieces can only capture with classical move and this force a calculation(if the target is quantum) on the target and a capture happens if the target is there else the piece moves there.
5. The pieces that can't jump can pass through quantum obstacles in a quantum move(Given that the obstacles aren't entangled with each other and they aren't entanged with the piece )(Thinking if I should implement this)
